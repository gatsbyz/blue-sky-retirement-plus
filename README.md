4. The CUI will show you the cities you can retire in.
5. Your retirement cities will be saved in `cache/retirement-cities.csv`
6. run `jupyter/retirement_tool.ipynb` to visualize your retirement data. the most recent user input will be used.
7. run `jupyter/map_retirement_cities.ipynb` to visualize your retirement cities. the most recent retirement cities will be used.

['Paris/France', 'Hamilton/Canada', 'Milan/Italy', 'Bucaramanga/Colombia', 'Madrid/Spain', 'Delhi/India']


# For Users -- General Overview & Flow

Part 1: Data inputs will be generated to determine the years in retirement, size and risk profile of the user's investment portfolio, and historical growth rates of indices.    

Part 2: Users will forecast the performance of their portfolio at the age they wish to retire until the time they choose to retire. Historical price data will be used to generate Monte Carlo simulations to compute total savings (mean) for the time, which elapses btwn the user's current age and the year they prefer to retire.

Part 3: This total cash savings, in addition to asset appreciation will be exported to the Cost of Living Calculator to determine the list of viable cities where the user can retire.

Getting User info:

```python
import questionary
def get_retire_plan_user():
    age = questionary.text("What is your current age").ask()
    retirement_age = questionary.text("By what age, would you prefer to retire?").ask()

    age = int(age)
    retirement_age = int(retirement_age)
    savings = float(savings)
    portfolio_type = int(portfolio_type)
    total_stocks_bonds = float(total_stocks_bonds)
    return age, retirement_age, savings, portfolio_type, total_stocks_bonds
```
